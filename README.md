Goldengate
==========

Goldengate intends to be a replacement for Cordova/PhoneGap on iOS and Mac. Why? Cordova is designed with the assumption that you don't want to know anything about native app development â€” and that is just plain annoing to me.

## Features

- built with WKWebView, Swift & CoffeeScript
- works on iOS and Mac
- very lightweight (no support for legacy systems, etc.)
- asynchronous calls using Promises, not callbacks
- (WIP) nice syntax for calling plugins from JS: `Goldengate.PluginName.method(args)`
- (WIP) a compatibility layer for importing existing Cordova plugins

## Issues

At the moment, Goldengate is (and can be) only a proof of concept, because WKWebView can't load web pages from the app bundle. This [has been fixed on the upstream repo](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/174029/trunk/Source/WebKit2/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/WKWebView.h), but it's possible that the necessary API won't be added until OS X 10.11 / iOS 9.

Idea to try: according to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/wkwebview/status/540914015934107648), WKWebView can load local files from /tmp. Can we try making a tmp directory at launch and copying the needed files there?

## Dependencies/setup

Xcode project requires Xcode 6.1 running on OS X 10.10. The web component requires CoffeeScript (accessible globally via `coffee` command).

You need [Pow](http://pow.cx) to serve the web page locally (as noted above, WKWebView can't load from app bundle). Point `~/.pow/goldengate` to the GoldengateJS directory. Alternatively, if you're using a different web server, edit the URL in AppDelegate.swift

If you're working on the web component, be sure to run the watcher script (`./watch` from GoldengateJS) beforehand. It will listen to changes in CoffeeScript files and compile them.
